<b>Key Features of ViewPager2:</b>
1. <b>Support for both Horizontal and Vertical Scrolling:</b> Unlike ViewPager, which only supports horizontal scrolling, ViewPager2 allows scrolling in both directions.
2. <b>Built on RecyclerView:</b> ViewPager2 is based on RecyclerView, which makes it more efficient and flexible. This allows you to use data adapters like RecyclerView.Adapter or FragmentStateAdapter.
3. <b>Improved Accessibility:</b> It has better support for accessibility tools, which makes it easier to handle accessibility events, screen readers, and other tools for differently-abled users.
4. <b>RTL Support:</b> Right-to-left (RTL) layout support is built-in, which simplifies development for apps supporting languages like Arabic or Hebrew.
5. <b>FragmentStateAdapter:</b> It uses FragmentStateAdapter instead of FragmentPagerAdapter for more efficient memory management. It only keeps the active fragment in memory and can recreate others when needed.
6. <b>Page Transformations:</b> ViewPager2 allows more flexible animations and transitions between pages using a PageTransformer.
